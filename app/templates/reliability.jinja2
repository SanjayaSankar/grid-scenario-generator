Generate a power grid scenario that meets the following reliability requirements:

System Reliability:
- N-1 contingency criteria
- Voltage stability margin
- Frequency stability margin
- Spinning reserve requirements

Component Reliability:
- Generator availability
- Line availability
- Transformer availability
- Load reliability requirements

Reliability Metrics:
- Expected Energy Not Served (EENS)
- Loss of Load Probability (LOLP)
- Expected Interruption Frequency (EIF)
- Expected Interruption Duration (EID)

Please generate a scenario that meets these reliability requirements while maintaining system stability.
