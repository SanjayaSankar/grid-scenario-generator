- Active power balance at each bus
- Reactive power balance at each bus
- Line flow equations
- Transformer equations

Voltage Constraints:
- Bus voltage magnitudes: 0.95-1.05 p.u.
- Voltage angle differences: Within stability limits

Line Flow Constraints:
- Active power flow: Within thermal limits
- Reactive power flow: Within voltage stability limits

Generation Constraints:
- Active power limits
- Reactive power limits
- Ramp rate limits
